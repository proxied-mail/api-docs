# Intro

Welcome to ProxiedMail docs. Currently we've described potential use cases for receiving email webhooks and creating proxy-emails via API.

## ProxiedMail Common Info

ProxiedMail mainly built to preserve privacy for those who need it, but in the same time we want to make email kind of great again.

So, we provide some additional features to our main service such as automatic creating of proxy-emails and receiving emails via webhooks.

## API

API mainly built as the REST API with JSON as a data format. We are using [JSON API](https://jsonapi.org/) specification for our API.
Over all you don't need much knowledge about JSON API to use our API, but it's good to know anyway. 
We have described anything with our request-response example and example of cURL request in [endpoints section](/docs/category/http-endpoints).

## Use Cases

Please check out  [use cases](/docs/category/use-cases) to see how you can use ProxiedMail API.
