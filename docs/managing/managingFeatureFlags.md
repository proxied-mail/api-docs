# Process of setting up the feature flag

## Creating feature flag"
It takes a few moments to create a feature flag via ABRouter UI.
Feature flag can enable or disable some features in your application with a click.

Login to your account

Click "Add new feature flag"

Imagine the name of the feature flag

Click "Create". 

## Enabling/Disabling the feature flag:

You can enable and disable the feature flag by the toggle on the dashboard. Changes will be automatically synced with your application.

## Deleting the feature flag
If you already running the feature flag in the application we highly don't recommend you delete the feature flag. It will not break your application, but can probably affect something. So, be careful and delete your feature flag if you are sure the experiment is not used in your app yet or anymore.
