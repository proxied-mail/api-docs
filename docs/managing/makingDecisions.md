# Making decisions

The main reason why we should use A/B testing is to optimize our conversions, LTV, and other metrics which will lead your product to grow.
The test should be running until the exact win for one of the branches.

But, winning by what? To define the winning rules we have to do some more things:

1. Collect and set up the built-in statistics
2. Define the key metrics as OKR (Objective Key Results)

So, when already collecting statistics and having the events on the dashboard you have to decide the key(OKRs) metrics for you, depends on you can decide on what branch is winning.
Don't rush, better to wait for enough collected data from the experiment and then, make the decision, set up the behavior of the winning branch as default in your product remove the experiment from the product codebase.
