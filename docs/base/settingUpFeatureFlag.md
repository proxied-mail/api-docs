# Process of setting up the feature flag

Feature flags are easier than experiments. Don't need to keep the eye on the statistic by feature flag, but you need to focus on why needed this feature flag and when to enable or disable it.

1. Create feature flag
2. Disable it
3. Integrate it into your code (see how to implement feature flags to your code)
4. Enable it to check it when needed

It's done. Your feature flag is working.
