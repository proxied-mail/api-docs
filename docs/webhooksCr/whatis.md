# What is built-in webhook-receivers ?

We have webhook receivers built-in in the system to 
all you to receive any kind of webhooks without having the need to set up webhook server.

It something like https://webhook.site/ but API-oriented.
We made it to allow you to receive our email-webhooks without additional hassle.

Using our API you can create webhook-receiver that gives you unique webhook URL, then connect this webhook to our proxy-email while you're making the call to webhook-receiver endpoint to check status if webhook was already received.
Check out next documentation in this section.
